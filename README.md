## Change Log

### Lab 07
- Name of Feature: Custom Servers
- Estimated time to complete:  I didn't really have any idea since back end was all brand new to me!
- Start time:  3:00pm
- Finish time: 8:00pm
- Actual time needed to complete:  There is a caveat here, first step was 5 hours, but I needed an additional hour the following day to fix a bug.  So total **actual** time = 6 hours.

### Lab 08

- Name of Feature: APIs
- Estimate time to complete: I wish I knew lol
- Start time: 3:30pm
- Finish time: 11:00pm

### Lab 09

- Name of Feature: Refactor
- Estimate time to complete:  I am not sure since I need to finish lab 08 still
- Start time: 1:30pm

## Credit and Collaborations

Tanner Percival has worked at my table a lot and we help eachother out.  I value his experience and he is a great partner.  Ryan Galloway also really helped steer me in the right direction during lab 08 and it was he who alerted me to the false alarm from the linter bug.
